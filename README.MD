I will later be adding this to NPM possibly if I don't find a better solution already created.

The purpose of this microservice allows you to:

1) input a JSON object

2) input an object key you want to search for in the JSON object

3) Returns all of the values that it found associated with that key in an array.

Note: A test JSON object is provided in order to get an idea of what the output will look like.

I'm still working on building a GUI to drop your own JSONs into, but feel free to fork and clone and use
just the index.js function for now.
